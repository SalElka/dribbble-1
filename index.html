			<h2>Final puts you in total payment control</h2>

			<p>Final let's you give a unique credit card number to every merchant, or a disposable one-time use umber for one-off purchases.</p>

			<p>Tired of your monthly yoga pants subscription? Or a two-week "free" trail that lasted four months? Just deactivate that card number. It's that easy.</p>

			<p>With Final, you can limit each merchant or subscription to a monthly amount. If the merchant attempts to go over that limit, you recieve a push notification, keeping you in the loop</p>

			<h2>Final is aligned with you, your goals, and how you buy.</h2>

			<p>You can limit your ability to spend based on your personal budget, and we will work with you towards building good credit, not bad debt.</p>

			<p>Your credit card should work for you, not against you. This is why we've built Final.</p>
